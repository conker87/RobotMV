//HOW TO USE THIS TILESET//
///////////////////////////

Hello, fellow game developer! Thank you for downloading the Station X tileset. Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this zip file.

Tips:

- You can find all the pieces to put together your levels in the "pieces" folder.

- I've also included sprite sheets for each style in the "spritesheet" folder, along with two metadata files. (Pick the format you like.)

- Many of the pieces are set up to align to an 8x8 grid. Remember this when you're putting it together!

- The large blocks with an "X" on them are animated. They have a 3-frame animation where the lights flash on the sides of the block.

- You can help make sense of the labels using the following guide, which applies to all my tilesets.

File name definitions:
	- "terrain"			Part of the tileset's terrain. The player probably stands on this.
	- "left/right/top/bottom"	The left/right/top/bottom wall or edge of the terrain.
	- "center"			Context-specific. Usually means the middle of something.
	- "bg1", "bg2", etc.		Background. Higher number indicates further back.
	- "fg1", "fg2", etc.		Foreground. Higher number indicates further forwards.
	- "_f1", "_f2", "_f3", etc.	Suffixes with "f" and a number indicate a frame of an animation.
	- "_1", "_2", "_3", etc.	A suffix with a number indicates there are multiple variants of this object.
	- "A1", "B1", etc.		"A," "B," "C," and so on also indicate different patterns, styles, or objects.
					The number following the letter indicates a variant.

- Don't know how to put something together? Take a look at the example/wallpaper image and it might be able to help you.

- Really curious how it was all made? Need some hints for layer ordering? Check out one of the PSDs in the PSD folder, or one of the .pyxel files in the pyxel folder.
